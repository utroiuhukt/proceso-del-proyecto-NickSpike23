What is morality?
========================

I have always wondered how something is declared "*morally acceptable.*" For me, morality meant the group cognition of "*what is right*" or "*what is wrong*", often driven solely by sentimentality. A clear example that comes to mind is the case of **Johnny Depp**, who was initially judged as an abuser due to accusations made by his ex-wife. Many people didn't even give Johnny the chance to defend himself, simply following their emotions. It wasn’t until the truth came to light, revealing that the accusations were false, that people began to reason and properly judge the case. This is why, after reading this week’s reading, I agreed with what morality should be.

For morality to function, judgments should be based on well-founded reasons, not emotions or customs. For example, in the past, feelings of racial superiority justified slavery and discrimination, distorting our perception of what is right simply because it was a deeply rooted tradition passed down by previous generations.

Another important aspect for morality to be properly implemented is that it should value everyone's interests equally, prohibiting discrimination without valid justification. This means it is acceptable to treat people differently only when there is a legitimate reason. For example, a director who chooses actors based on the needs of a role is not discriminating but acting with reason.

**In conclusion**, morality should be guided by well-structured reasoning and impartiality, in order to promote a more equitable society.
