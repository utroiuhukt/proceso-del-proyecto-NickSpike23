Activity 2
========================
## Ashley Madison
In my opinion, the hackers' decision to attack Ashley Madison is more correct than incorrect, as it exposed thousands of infidelities that broke the trust in relationships. This revelation allowed many people to discover the truth about their partners, opening their eyes to betrayals that were harming their marriages. As a result, many chose to divorce, unable to rebuild trust. From this perspective, the action can be seen as positive because it enabled people to make informed decisions about their relationships, which, in the long run, could contribute to social well-being by fostering more authentic and honest relationships.

However, it is impossible to ignore the elephant in the room: this hack violated users' privacy, exposing them to the public and causing significant emotional harm. Many people experienced humiliation, social rejection, and even faced extreme consequences such as suicide. Furthermore, not all users of the platform were necessarily engaging in infidelity, which amplifies the harm caused to people who did not act immorally.
